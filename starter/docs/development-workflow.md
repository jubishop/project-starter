# Development workflow

This page records this project's own commands and integrations. Shared rules
are in the [foundation pages](foundation/README.md).

## Setup

```sh
bin/setup
bin/doctor
bin/check --full
```

Setup needs Git and Python 3.9 or later, and checks also need ShellCheck.
QMD and direnv are optional; setup reports skipped features. Install td and
run `td init` as described in [task tracking](foundation/task-tracking.md).
Create `.envrc` only when the project needs environment settings, and review
it before running `direnv allow`; search does not need it.

## Checks

Follow the [check schedule](foundation/engineering-policy.md#checks). Describe
what this project's `bin/check-application` runs, or state that the project
has no application checks yet.

## Runtime and toolchain versions

List the supported versions and where they are declared, following the
[version policy](foundation/engineering-policy.md#runtime-and-toolchain-versions).

## Deployment

Describe how the project deploys, how nonfunctional changes skip deployment,
and the manual override, following the
[deployment policy](foundation/engineering-policy.md#deployment-decisions).

## Project Starter

`.project-starter.json` records the installed Project Starter release and the
hashes of its managed files. Update them with Project Starter's `bin/sync`,
and record any intentional local change as an override with its reason.

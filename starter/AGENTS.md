# Project instructions

<!-- project-starter:begin -->
Project Starter manages this block; add project rules after it.

- Keep durable guidance and non-derivable context in [memory](memory/README.md),
  and designs, decisions, and research in [docs](docs/README.md). Before
  non-trivial work or writing memory, search with `bin/knowledge search "term"`
  or `bin/knowledge query "question" --no-rerank`, then read results with
  `bin/knowledge get <path> -l 80`. Markdown sources are authoritative.
- If configured QMD fails, tell the user immediately and attempt repair. If
  repair fails, pause knowledge-dependent work until the user approves a
  fallback; never silently substitute `rg` or direct reads. See
  [search failures](docs/foundation/knowledge-search.md#search-failures).
- Use td for work with multiple stages, interruptions, blockers, or handoffs;
  run `td usage --new-session -q` once per new context and keep handoffs
  current. See [task tracking](docs/foundation/task-tracking.md).
- Follow the [engineering policy](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md):
  fewer dependencies, red-green tests for behavior changes, cohesive files and
  pages, checkout-isolated validation, and declared toolchain versions.
- Run [checks](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md#checks) by change:
  `bin/check --documents-only` for Markdown, application checks for code, and
  `bin/check --full` before merge or release unless an enforced CI gate runs
  it. Skip checks for read-only work and reuse passing results.
- Keep accepted decisions separate from proposals, preserve unrelated changes,
  and keep secrets and generated caches out of Git.
- Run `bin/setup` after cloning, `bin/doctor` to diagnose setup, and
  `bin/qmd-index` after uncommitted knowledge edits. Managed files listed in
  `.project-starter.json` change only through Project Starter or a recorded
  override with its reason.
